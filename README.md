# Forget me, Facebook!

Periodically delete old Facebook interactions (posts, likes, tags, event attendance, etc.)

## Install

Install casperjs via npm. Have python3.

## Run

`python3 forget.py` -- this will run a python script that runs the casper script. It'll fill the email and password fields on Facebook but won't submit them. Then it will wait 6 seconds and take a screenshot to prove it.
